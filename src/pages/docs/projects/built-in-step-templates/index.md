Octopus includes built-in step templates that have been developed by the Octopus team to handle the most common deployment scenarios. In addition to the built-in step templates, there are also [Community Step Templates](/docs/projects/community-step-templates/) that have been contributed by the community. You can also use the built-in step templates as the base to create [custom steps templates](/docs/projects/custom-step-templates) to use across your projects.
