Octopus Deploy can work with any http/https load balancer technology.  There are plenty of options when it comes to choosing a load balancer to direct user traffic between each of the Octopus Server nodes.

## Load Balancer Basics

Octopus Server provides a health check endpoint for your load balancer to ping: `/api/octopusservernodes/ping`.

:::

Making a standard `HTTP GET` request to this URL on your Octopus Server nodes will return:

- HTTP Status Code `200 OK` as long as the Octopus Server node is online and not in [drain mode](#drain).
- HTTP Status Code `418 I'm a teapot` when the Octopus Server node is online, but it is currently in [drain mode](#drain) preparing for maintenance.
- Anything else indicates the Octopus Server node is offline, or something has gone wrong with this node.

:::div{.hint}
The Octopus Server node configuration is also returned as JSON in the HTTP response body.

We typically recommend using a round-robin (or similar) approach for sharing traffic between the nodes in your cluster, as the Octopus Web Portal is stateless.

All package uploads are sent as a POST to the REST API endpoint `/api/[SPACE-ID]/packages/raw`.  Because the REST API will be behind a load balancer, you'll need to configure the following on the load balancer:

- Timeout: Octopus is designed to handle 1 GB+ packages, which takes longer than the typical http/https timeout to upload.
- Request Size: Octopus does not have a size limit on the request body for packages.  Some load balancers only allow 2 or 3 MB files by default.
