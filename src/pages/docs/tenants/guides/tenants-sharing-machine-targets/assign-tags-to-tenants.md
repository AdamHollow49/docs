## Mapping Tenants to Hosting Groups with Tags

We have included the hosting group name in the tenant name to help illustrate the pattern. In the screenshot below, you can see that the tenants have been assigned a Hosting Group tag based on which group they belong to.

This tag will make it easy to choose to deploy to all tenants in a group easily and also map those tenants to the correct infrastucture easily.

Edit a tenant and click the `Manage Tags` button to manage what tags are associated with a tenant.
