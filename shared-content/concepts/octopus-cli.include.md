The Octopus CLI is a command line tool that builds on top of the [Octopus Deploy REST API](/docs/octopus-rest-api). With the Octopus CLI you can package your applications for deployment as either Zip or NuGet packages, and manage your environments, deployments, channels, projects, and workers.

The Octopus CLI can be used on Windows, Mac, Linux, Docker, and as a .NET Core global tool. For installation options and direct downloads, visit [Download Octopus CLI](https://octopus.com/downloads/octopuscli).

:::hint
The Octopus CLI is built and maintained by the Octopus Deploy team, but it is also open source. You can [view the Octopus CLI project on GitHub](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusCli), which leans heavily on the [Octopus Clients library](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusClients).
