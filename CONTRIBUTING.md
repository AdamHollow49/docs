# Contributing to the Octopus Deploy Documentation

This document covers the process for contributing to the documentation and code samples that are hosted on the [Octopus Deploy documentation site](https://octopus.com/docs/).

Documentation is stored in this repository as Markdown files. The site is rendered using [markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig). Markdig supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) as well as some extra syntax.

Before we can accept your contribution, you need you to sign the [Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/OctopusDeploy/docs).

## Contribute a Quick Fix

If you spotted a typo, a small error, or a simple omission that you'd like to fix, you can make these changes in the GitHub editor. Once the changes have been made, GitHub makes it easy to [submit your changes as a new branch and start a pull request(PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/). We will review your PR and accept it or suggest changes.

## Contribute More Complex Changes

If you'd like to contribute more complex changes to the documentation, you'll need an understanding of [Git and GitHub.com](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and an awareness of the [conventions](#conventions) used throughout our documentation.

The basic process is:

* Fork this repo and create a branch for your changes.
* Make the changes you'd like to contribute.
* Submit a pull request (PR) to master with your changes and include a comment explaining the changes.
* Sign the [Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/OctopusDeploy/docs).
* We'll review your PR and accept it or suggest changes.

## Conventions

Our goal is to make the documentation as accessible as possible to the reader. These conventions are intended to help our contributors maintain a consistent style and voice throughout the documentation.

### Voice and Style

Not everybody who reads the Octopus Deploy documentation is a native English speaker with a degree in computer science, though many are. To make the documentation as widely accessible as possible we recommend:

- Address the reader directly by writing in second person. Imagine you are talking to the reader.
- Use an informal tone and simple, declarative language.
- Define technical terms the reader might not be familiar with.
- Use simple sentence structures to avoid overloading the reader with too much information all at once.
- Use US English spelling.
- Try to anticipate why somebody would read the documentation and the types of problems they are trying to solve. Instead of describing features, explain what users can do with them and how they do it.
- Avoid overly formal language or an academic style.
- Avoid slang, colloquialisms, and other terms the reader might not be familiar with.

### How to Structure Content

When creating new documentation, you should structure it as follows:

1. Introduction.

  Provide an introduction that explains what the documentation covers and provide some sample scenarios for when users might want to implement it. For instance:

  > This document explains how to install Octopus Deploy for fast, reliable, repeatable deployments.

2. Procedural.

  Next, walk the user through the process you're describing with easy to follow step-by-step instructions. Try to focus on the most common use cases and provide a direct path the user can follow to achieve the goal of the procedure.

  > 1. Select Projects from the main navigation, and click ADD PROJECT.
  > 2. Give the project a name that's meaningful to you, and anybody else who'll work on the project.
  > 3. ...

3. Reference.

  If there are lists of parameters or additional options available, provide the details in a list or table for easy access after the procedural content. If there are common troubleshooting steps users might need to perform, list them here.

4. Next.

  Provide links to related documentation to help the reader continue their journey.

## Working with Files and Folders

The folder structure in the GitHub docs repository, determines the structure of [www.octopus.com/docs](https://www.octopus.com/docs) and the navigation menu for the docs. For instance, the contents of the file located at `docs/installation/downloads.md` can be viewed at the URL [www.octopus.com/docs/installation/downloads](https://octopus.com/docs/installation/downloads). Note, the markdown file extension `.md` is not present in the URL.

The only exception to this rule, is index pages, see the next section for details.

### Index Pages

Each directory needs an index.md page with the content that will be displayed on the equivalent page in the docs. For instance, the contents of the file `docs/installation/index.md` is available at the URL: [www.octopus.com/docs/installation](https://octopus.com/docs/installation). Note, `index.md` is not part of the URL.

### Filenames

Filenames must be in lowercase and delimited with a dash `-`. For instance, `backup-and-restore.md`, or `dashboard.png`.

### Headers

Each document has a header. It is enclosed by `---` and is defined in a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) document format.
If you need to review your document in GitHub, the UI will [correctly render YAML](https://github.com/blog/1647-viewing-yaml-metadata-in-your-documents). The header is where you define the title of the page and provide a description of the page. For example:

```md
---
title: Getting Started
description: A Conceptual Overview of Octopus Deploy.
position: 0
---
```

#### Title (required)
Used for the web page title tag `<head><title>`, displayed in the page content.

Please use Title Case for titles. If you're not sure what makes title case, there are a few converters online, for instance: http://titlecaseconverter.com/.

#### Description (required)

Used for the meta description tag (`<meta name="description" />`).
Keep the description under 160 characters.

Read [how to write a good description](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description).

#### Position (optional)
Used to set the position of the document in the menu.

#### hideInThisSection (optional)

Index pages (`index.md`) automatically have an "In This Section" section added below the content of the page, which lists all child pages in the folder. If the page does not need this section, you can stop it from being displayed, by adding the following metadata to the YAML:

```yaml
hideInThisSection: true
```

The "In This Section" section [contains a header](_shared/in-this-section.md), if you don't want the header to be displayed, but still want the list of child pages to show up, you can omit the header by adding the following metadata to the YAML:

```yaml
hideInThisSectionHeader: true
```

### Using and Defining Includes

Sometimes you need to the same content in multiple pages, using includes lets you write the content once, and include it in more than one place. Markdown includes are pulled into the document prior to passing the content through the markdown conversion.

To create an include, add a file anywhere in the docs repository that is suffixed with `.include.md`. For example, the file might be named `theKey.include.md`. To include the content in `theKey.include.md` in another file, add the following to the markdown `!include <key>` in that file.

### Redirects

If you delete or rename a file, you need to add a redirect for that file otherwise publishing will fail.

Redirects are added to [redirects.txt](redirects.txt).

The redirects.txt file looks something like:
```
from-file-path -> to-file-path                 #DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE
docs/page1.md -> docs/page2.md
```
In the above example, `/docs/page1` is redirected to `/docs/page2`.

Add your redirect to the end of the file, after the redirect is added, the original file (`page1`) needs to be deleted from the repo.

## Working With the Content

### Table of Contents

You can include a table of contents by adding `!toc` to the markdown. The table of contents lists all headers (H1, H2, etc) in the current document.

### Headings

The first (and all top level) headers in a `.md` page should be a `h2` (i.e., `##`) with sub-headings under it being `h3`, `h4`, etc.
DO NOT skip heading levels, i.e., h1 > h2 > h4 is not valid!

You must also separate the `##` and the text of the heading with a space. Without the space, the heading will not render correctly on the Octopus docs site (though it will render correctly in the GitHub preview).

### Images

Images can be incredibly helpful for your audience, but the downside of images is how quickly they can become outdated and leave your reader feeling confused if they're not updated.

Before adding a screenshot of the Octopus UI (or another UI), consider the following:

1. How likely is it the UI will change and the old screenshot will confuse readers?
1. Have you provided text that describes the steps users need to take (for accessibility reasons you shouldn't rely on screenshots to relay information). If the text is clear enough, is the screenshot still necessary?

Put images in the same folder as the markdown file that references it.

Images can be added using the following markdown syntax:

    ![Alt text](img.jpg)

**All** images should have [alt text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute).

### Application Paths

In order to be consistent when referencing certain areas of the application we have created a markdown extension to render application paths. To render an application path use the following syntax:

```md
{{my,application,path}} or {{my>application>path}}
```
The `,` or `>` are the separator characters.

For example:

```md
To enable Docker in your Octopus Server instance, toggle the feature on via {{Configuration,Features,Docker}}.
```

### Links

Links to other pages in the documentation should be relative and contain the `.md` extension.
The `.md` allows links to work inside the GitHub web UI. The `.md` will be trimmed when they are finally rendered.

#### Anchors

One addition to standard markdown is the auto creation of anchors for headings.

So if you have a heading like this:

    ## My Heading

it will be converted to this:

    <h2>
      <a name="my-heading"/>
      My Heading
    </h2>

Which means elsewhere in the page you can link to it with this:

    [Goto My Heading](#My-Heading)
    [Goto a different page](/docs/getting-started.md#My-Heading)

If you create anchors in the markdown, do not use special characters in the anchor text as they will cause the link to be truncated.

### Code Samples

Use GitHub-style fenced code blocks. Example:

    ​```powershell
    Write-Host "Hello"
    ​```

If your example uses multiple languages or files, you can combine them together and add tab headings - they will be rendered as tabs:

    ​```powershell PowerShell
    Write-Host "Hello"
    ​```
    ​```c# C#
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    ​```

Snippets are highlighted by Highlight.js

* [Documentation](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/)
* [Language List](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/css-classes-reference.html#language-names-and-aliases)

| language     | key            |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| c#           | `cs`           |
| xml          | `xml`          |
| no format    | `no-highlight` |
| command line | `bash`         |
| powershell   | `ps`           |
| json         | `json`         |
| sql          | `sql`          |
| f#           | `fsharp`       |
| text         | text           |

**Always use fenced code blocks with a language.** If no language is defined then highlightjs will guess the language and it regularly gets it wrong.

### Alerts

Sometimes it's necessary to draw attention to items you want to call out in a document.

When used sparingly, alerts can effectively draw the user's attention to important information. When used excessively, alerts can have the opposite effect and train users to ignore the alerts. Before adding an alert, consider if it is the best approach or if the user might benefit from the information being presented as part of the main body of text.

Alerts are added through bootstrap alerts https://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts.

There are several keys, each of which map to a different colored alert:

| Key       | Color  |
| --------- | ------ |
| `success` | green  |
| `hint`    | blue   |
| `warning` | yellow |
| `problem` | red    |

Use the following syntax to add keys:

```md
:::hint
**Guess what**
The answer is 42.
:::
```

will be rendered as
```html
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Guess what</strong></br>
The answer is 42.</p>
</div>
```

### Lists
Lists can be created using a few different styles, please be aware that `Roman` and `Letters` won't render properly in GitHub (this is a markdig extension).

To ensure the list items are correctly formatted it is recommended not to number the items, instead let the markdown renderer do that job automatically, so for a numeric list use one `1`s for a letter list use one `a.`s and for a roman list use only `i`s.

#### Nested Lists

You can nest lists, by adding four spaces before the nested list items.

#### Bullets
Example:
```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
```

Rendered as:

- Item 1
- Item 2

#### Numbered
Example:
```md
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
```

Rendered as:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

#### Roman
Example:
```md
i. Item 1
i. Item 2
```

Rendered as:

i. Item 1  
ii. Item 2

#### Letters
Example:
```md
a. Item 1
a. Item 2
```

Rendered as:

a. Item 1  
b. Item 2

### Versions

The version dropdown menu let's user choose between [legacy versions](https://legacydocs.octopus.com) of the documentation, the latest (default) version, and any pre-release versions.

### Include Pre-release Documentation

The list of versions displayed on the dropdown are loaded from [versions.json](versions.json).

Support to publish pre-release versions of documentation.
This is useful when we are planning a new release or we are releasing betas or RCs.

To use this functionality all you need to do is add the pre-release version to the versions.json file versions array, and leave the default the same version, the example above adds 2018.4 pre-release:
```json
{
   "versions": [
     "2018.3",
     "2018.4"
   ],
   "default": "2018.3",
   "legacy": [
    {
      "version": "2018.2",
      "firstReleased": "8 Feb 2018"
     },
     {
      "version": "2018.1",
      "firstReleased": "24 Jan 2018"
     },
     {
      "version": "4.1",
      "firstReleased": "5 Dec 2017"
     }
   ]
 }
```

The version selector on the website displays the latest version by default, but the new pre-release is now listed above:

![](/docs/images/version-selector.png)

And when selected, a banner tells the user that they are seeing a "preview" of the documentation:

![](/docs/images/preview.png)

### Partials
Partials are version specific files that contain markdown.
Markdown partials are pulled into the document prior to includes, so this means you can add includes to partials.
They are only rendered in the target page when the version filter matches the convention for a give file.

Partial Convention: filePrefix_key_version.partial.md

### Defining and Using Partials

Add a file in the same folder as the page where you will use the partial to the docs repository that is named `fileName_key_version.partial.md`. For example, the file might be named `getting-started_theKey_2.0.partial.md`.

To include the content in the partial, add the following to the markdown: `!partial <key>` (including the `<>`s)
