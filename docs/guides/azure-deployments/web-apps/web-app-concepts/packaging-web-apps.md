## Generate a NuGet package {#PackagingWebApps-GenerateaNuGetpackage}

Octopus requires a Web Apps to be packaged in NuGet package for use by Octopus. The easiest way generate a NuGet package is to use the [Octo.exe](/docs/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octo.exe.md) command line tool:

**Packaging a Cloud Service with Octo.exe**

```powershell
Octo.exe pack --id=HelloWeb --basePath=C:\PathToWebApp
```

Octo.exe will generate a NuGet package containing your Web App:

Here is a sample Web App NuGet package: [HelloWeb.1.0.0.nupkg](https://download.octopusdeploy.com/demo/HelloWeb.1.0.0.nupkg)

## Upload to a NuGet feed {#PackagingWebApps-UploadtoaNuGetfeed}

In order to make the NuGet package accessible to Octopus it needs to be uploaded to a [package repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/index.md). The built-in Octopus package repository is accessible from Library > Packages and is a suitable place to upload your Web App NuGet package:
