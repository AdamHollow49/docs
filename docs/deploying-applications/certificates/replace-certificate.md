title: Replace a Certificate 
position: 4

The Replace Certificate feature is designed for the scenario where a new certificate has been obtained via a renewal process. 

The new certificate will assume the ID of the previous certificate, meaning all referencing variables will now refer to the new certificate.

The previous certificate will be [archived](/docs/deploying-applications/certificates/archiving-and-deleting-certificates.md). 

To replace a certificate, navigate to the certificate details page and click 'Replace'.
