## Step {#Systemvariables-Step}

Step-level variables are available during execution of a step. Indexer notion such as `Octopus.Step[Website].Number` can be used to refer to values for different steps.

| Name                            | Example                                  | Description                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Octopus.Step.Id                 | *80b3ad09-eedf-40d6-9b66-cf97f5c0ffee*   | The ID of the step                       |
| Octopus.Step.Name               | *Website*                                | The name of the step                     |
| Octopus.Step.Number             | *2*                                      | The number of the step*(Number)*         |
| Octopus.Step.Status.Code        | *Succeeded*                              | A code describing the current status of the step |
| Octopus.Step.Status.Error       | *The server could not be contacted*      | If the step failed because of an error, a description of the error |
| Octopus.Step.Status.ErrorDetail | *System.Net.SocketException: The server could not be contacted (at ...)* | If the step failed because of an error, a full description of the error |

## Agent {#Systemvariables-Agent}

Agent-level variables describe the deployment agent or Tentacle on which the deployment is executing.

| Name                                     | Example                                  | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Octopus.Tentacle.Agent.ApplicationDirectoryPath | *C:\Octopus\Tentacle\Apps*               | The directory under which the agent installs packages |
| Octopus.Tentacle.Agent.InstanceName      | *Tentacle*                               | The instance name that the agent runs under |
| Octopus.Tentacle.Agent.ProgramDirectoryPath | *C:\Program Files\Octopus Deploy\Tentacle* | The directory containing the agent's own executables |
| **Octopus.Agent.ProgramDirectoryPath**   | *C:\Program Files\Octopus Deploy\Octopus* | The directory containing either the server or tentacle's executables depending on which the step being executed on |

## Server {#Systemvariables-Server}

Server-level variables describe the Octopus server on which the deployment is running.

| Name                | Example                                  | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Octopus.Web.BaseUrl | *[https://my-octopus](https://my-octopus)* | The default URL at which the server can be accessed |

## Tracking deployment status {#Systemvariables-DeploymentStatusTrackingdeploymentstatus}

During deployment, Octopus provides variables describing the status of each step.

Where `S` is the step name, Octopus will set:

```powershell
Octopus.Step[S].Status.Code
Octopus.Step[S].Status.Error
Octopus.Step[S].Status.ErrorDetail
```

Status codes include `Pending`, `Skipped`, `Abandoned`, `Cancelled`, `Running`, `Succeeded` and `Failed`.

For an action `A:`

```powershell
Octopus.Action[A].IsSkipped
```

For the deployment as a whole:

```powershell
Octopus.Deployment.Error
Octopus.Deployment.ErrorDetail
```

:::hint
**Error detail returned**
Octopus.Deployment.Error and Octopus.Deployment.ErrorDetail will only display the exit code and Octopus stack trace for the error. As we cannot parse the deployment log, we can only extract the exit/error codes. It cannot show detailed information on what caused the error. For full information on what happened when the deployment fails, you will need to reference the logs.

## User-modifiable settings {#Systemvariables-User-modifiablesettings}

The following variables can be defined as variables in your project to modify the way Octopus behaves.

| Name                                     | Example | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Octopus.Acquire.MaxParallelism**       | 3       | Maximum number of NuGet packages that should be downloaded at once when acquiring packages. |
| **OctopusPrintVariables**                | True    | Set to "True" to tell Tentacle to print the value of all variables passed to it. We recommend only using this setting for non-production environments. |
| **OctopusPrintEvaluatedVariables**       | True    | Set to "True" to tell Tentacle to print the value of all variables passed to it after evaluating them. We recommend only using this setting for non-production environments. |
| **OctopusTreatWarningsAsErrors**         | True    | Set to "True" to have warnings from XML configuration transforms or PowerShell scripts treated as if they were errors, failing the deployment. |
| **OctopusSkipFreeDiskSpaceCheck**        | True    | Set to "True" to skip the check for available free disk space when deploying packages. ***Introduced in Calamari version 3.1.30 which was released with Octopus Deploy version 3.2.18.*** |
| **OctopusFreeDiskSpaceOverrideInMegaBytes** | 100     | The amount (in megabytes) of available free disk space we should check for (overriding the default 500MB), failing the deployment if not enough free disk space is available. ***Introduced in Calamari version 3.1.30 which was released with Octopus Deploy version 3.2.18.*** |
| **Octopus.Action.PowerShell.CustomPowerShellVersion** | 2.0     | If specified, your PowerShell scripts will be invoked using `PowerShell.exe -version {Version}` where {Version} is the value you specified. Accepted values are *2.0*, *3.0*, *4.0, 5.0* ***Introduced in Calamari version 3.3.13 which was released with Octopus Deploy version 3.3.13.*** |
| **OctopusDeleteScriptsOnCleanup**        | False   | For packaged scripts, set to "False" to keep the PreDeploy/Deploy/PostDeploy scripts in the target directory (i.e. don't cleanup). |
| **Octopus.Action.Script.SuppressEnvironmentLogging** | True    | To suppress/disable the environment logging that occurs from script (eg. PowerShell or Bash Script Environment Variables logging). This only suppresses script logging and does not suppress the Octopus or Calamari environment logging. ***Introduced in Calamari version 3.6.5 which was released with Octopus Deploy version 3.6.0.*** |
