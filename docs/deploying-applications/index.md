Deploying software with Octopus Deploy involves [packaging your applications](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md) and [configuring your infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/index.md). With those two steps completed, you need to define your [deployment process](/docs/deploying-applications/deployment-process/index.md) by creating a [project](/docs/deploying-applications/projects/index.md), adding  [steps]() and [configuration variables]().
