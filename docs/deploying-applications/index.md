Deploying software with Octopus Deploy involves [packaging your applications](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md) and [configuring your infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/index.md). With those two steps completed, you need to define your [deployment process](/docsindex.md) by creating a [project](/docsprojects/index.md), adding  [steps](/docssteps/index.md) and [configuration variables](/docsvariables/index.md), and creating [releases](/docsreleases/index.md).

The first part of this section focuses on the [Deployment Process](/docsindex.md), and the rest of this section goes into details for specific deployments.
