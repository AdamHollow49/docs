This guide will introduce you to Software as a Service (SaaS) multi-tenant deployments in Octopus. In this guide, we will be deploying an application called **Vet Clinic**. When a customer signs up to Vet Clinic, they get their own [Azure Web App](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/azure/web-app-targets/index.md) and database for staging and production, choosing which region the application and data are hosted in.
