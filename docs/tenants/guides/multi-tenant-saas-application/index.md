description: A guide showing you how to use tenants to deploy a multi-tenant SaaS application using Octopus Deploy.
position: 10

This guide will introduce you to Software as a Service (SaaS) multi-tenant deployments in Octopus. In this guide, we will be deploying an application called Vet Clinic. When a customer signs up to Vet Clinic, they get their own Azure Web App and database for staging and production, choosing which region the application and data are hosted in.

:::hint
Multi-tenant deployments are an advanced pattern, and these guides assume you are already familiar with Octopus concepts like [projects](/docs/projects/index.md), [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md), [lifecycles](/docs/releases/lifecycles/index.md), [variables](/docs/projects/variables/index.md) and [deploying applications](/docs/deployments/index.md).
