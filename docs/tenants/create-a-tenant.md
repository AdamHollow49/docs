2. Enter the name you want to use for the tenant and click the **Save** button:

And that's it, you've created your first tenant! You may have noticed you cannot do much with that tenant on it's own.

The next steps are:
- Enable [tenanted deployments](/docs/tenants/enabling-tenanted-deployments.md) in a project.
- Connect [a tenant to a project](/docs/tenants/connecting-projects.md).

## Add your logo {#add-logo}

Try adding a logo for your tenant - this will make it much easier to distinguish your tenants. You can do this within the Octopus Tenant section by clicking on the tenant's logo placeholder or going to the Settings tab on the tenant.

Your tenants will likely be other businesses, and you could use their logo to help quickly identify the correct tenant.

You could consider using logos based on:

- Customer logos
- Data center region(s) or flags
- Individual tester(s) photo/avatar
