Octopus Cloud is the hosted version of Octopus Deploy.

We designed Octopus Cloud and self-hosted Octopus to provide the same functionality; however, with Octopus Cloud we're responsible for backups, automatically upgrading the service, and maintaining and monitoring the underlying systems. 

You can sign up for Octopus Cloud at [octopus.com/free](https://octopus.com/free).
