Projects let you manage multiple software projects from the **Octopus Web Portal**. For each project you have, you define a deployment process (the steps or actions required to deploy your software), configuration variables (for example, application settings, database connection strings), and the environments the software will be deployed to (for example, development, test, and production).

Projects can consist of multiple steps and deliverable components or they might only have a single step.
