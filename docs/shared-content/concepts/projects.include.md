Projects let you create and manage your deployment processes, releases, and operations runbooks.

Projects let you manage multiple software projects from the **Octopus Web Portal**. For each project, you can define a [deployment process](/docs/deployment-process/index.md) (the steps or actions required to deploy your software), operations runbooks to manage your infrastructure, configuration variables (for example, application settings, database connection strings), the environments the software will be deployed, and releases of your software.

You can manage your projects by navigating to the **Projects** tab in the Octopus Web Portal:
