Projects let you create and manage your deployment processes, releases, and runbooks from the Octopus REST API and Octopus Web Portal.

For each project, you can define a deployment process, runbooks to manage your infrastructure, variables, the environments where the software will be deployed, and releases of your software.

You can manage your projects by navigating to the **Projects** tab in the Octopus Web Portal:
