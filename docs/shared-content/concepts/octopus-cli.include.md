The Octopus CLI is a command line tool that builds on top of the [Octopus Deploy REST API](/docs/octopus-rest-api/index.md). With the Octopus CLI you can package your applications for deployment as either Zip or NuGet packages, and manage your environments, deployments, channels, projects, and workers.
