A release is a snapshot of the deployment process and the associated assets as they existed when the release was created. These assets include scripts, any references to package versions and variables (excluding tenant variables). A version number is assigned to a release. Releases can be deployed as many times as necessary, even if the deployment process has since been changed for newer releases.

When you deploy a release, you are executing the deployment process with all the associated details as they existed when the release was created.
