The Octopus Deploy Server is the deployment automation server that orchestrates your releases and deploys your software, manages your deployment processes and runbooks.

![Octopus Dashboard](/docs/shared-content/concepts/images/dashboard.png)

You can use the Octopus REST API or the Octopus Web Portal to design your deployment processes and your releases, connect to the servers, services, and accounts where your software will be deployed, and to use runbooks to automate routine maintenance and emergency operations tasks like infrastructure provisioning, database management, and website failover and restoration.

The Octopus Deploy Server can be installed in a self-hosted environment or accessed through the managed Octopus Cloud service.
