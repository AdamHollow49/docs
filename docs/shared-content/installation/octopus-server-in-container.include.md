Running Octopus Server inside a container lets you avoid installing Octopus directly on top of your infrastructure and makes getting up and running with Octopus as simple as a one line command. Upgrading to the latest version of Octopus is just a matter of running a new container with the new image version. 

From **Octopus 2020.6**, we publish `linux/amd64` Docker images for each Octopus Server release and they are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/octopusdeploy/).
