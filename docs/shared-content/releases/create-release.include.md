## Create a release

1. With your deployment process defined, you can create a release on the project's Overview page, by clicking **CREATE RELEASE**.

1. Depending on the type of steps you configured in the deployment process, there could be additional options available, for instance, if you're using a step to deploy a package, there will be a package section where you can specify which version of the package to use in the release.
1. Give the release a version number, add any release notes you'd like to include, and click **SAVE**.
