Community step templates are publicly available step templates that are contributed and updated by the community. These are incredibly useful. If you can't find a built-in step template that includes the actions you need, check the community step template. There is a large number and variety of step templates (and it's growing all the time) that can help you automate your deployment without writing any scripts yourself. The community step templates are third party code which is licensed under [the Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Library/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

Octopus community step templates integration was introduced in Octopus 3.7 and is enabled by default.

## Enable/Disable Community Step Templates Integration

1. Navigate to {{Configuration,Features}}.
2. Expand the **Octopus Community Step Template** section by clicking on it.
3. Toggle the select to either **Enabled** or **Disabled**, and click **SAVE**.

## The Community Library {#StepTemplates-TheCommunityLibrary}

Is there something Octopus doesn't support out-of-the-box? Take a look at the [Community Library](https://library.octopus.com/) which is full of step templates that have been contributed and are maintained by the Octopus community.

:::hint
Octopus 3.7 introduced integration with the Community Library and community contributed step templates are now synchronized with the Octopus server. This change makes it a quick and easy process to install and add community step templates. The import and export process is still available for older versions of Octopus.

1. Navigate to the [Community Library](http://library.octopus.com/) website, find the template you want to use and click on the **Copy to clipboard** button. *Step Templates are transported as a JSON document containing all of the information required by Octopus.*

## Adding an updated version of a community step template {#Addingsteps-Addinganupdatedversionofacommunitysteptemplate}

Sometimes updates are available for step templates.  In this case, you will notice the step template has an option to update the step.  If you select update, this will take you to the community step details with the option to update the latest version of the step template.  Community step templates can also be updated in the library as needed.
