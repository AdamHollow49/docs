The Windows Services feature is one of the [configuration features](/docs/projects/steps/configuration-features/index.md) you can enable as you define the [steps](/docs/deployment-process/steps/index.md) in your [deployment process](/docs/deployment-process/index.md).

The **Windows Service** feature is available on **deploy a package** steps, however, there is also a **Deploy a Windows Service** step which let you install, reconfigure, and start Windows Services during deployment. See [Windows Services](/docs/deployments/windows/windows-services.md) for more details.
