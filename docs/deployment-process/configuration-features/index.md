One of the essential steps in deploying software is configuring it to work with specific environments. This might mean pointing your application to the right database connection string, tweaking settings to run in production, or specifying a custom installation directory. Many of the steps that you define as part of your deployment process can have additional configuration features enabled.

## Enable Configuration Features

You enable configuration features, as you define the [steps](/docs/deployment-process/steps/index.md) in your [deployment process](/docs/deployment-process/index.md).

1. If the step you are defining has configuration features available, there is a **CONFIGURE FEATURES** link. Click this link.
1. Select the features you would like to enable by clicking the relevant checkboxes in the list and click **OK**.

The features you have enabled will now be available in the **Features** section of the step you are defining.

:::hint
Only steps the features can be used with, will have the features listed as options.

Steps that are not compatible with any of the configuration features, will not show the **CONFIGURE FEATURES** link.
