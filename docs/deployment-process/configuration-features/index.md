One of the essential steps in deploying software is configuring it to work with specific environments. This might mean pointing your application to the right database connection string, tweaking settings to run in production, or specifying a custom installation directory.

You enable configuration features, as you define your deployment process. Compatible steps have a **Configure features** link next to the save button.

1. [Custom Installation Directory](/docs/deployment-process/configuration-features/custom-installation-directory.md)
1. IIS Web Site and Application Pool
1. Windows Service
1. Custom Deployment Scripts
1. JSON Configuration Variables

1. [Substitute Variables in Files](/docs/deployment-process/configuration-features/substitute-variables-in-files.md)
1. IIS6+ Home Directory
