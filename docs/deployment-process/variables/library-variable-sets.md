Library variable sets make it possible to **share variables between projects.** You can create them from the **Variable Sets** tab in the **Library** area, by clicking **Add new variable set**.

Just like defining project variables, library variables can be scoped to environments, machines or roles.

Once library variable sets have been defined, they can be referenced from a project by viewing the project variables, selecting **Library Sets** and clicking **Include library variable sets**.
