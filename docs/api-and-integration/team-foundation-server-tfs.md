Octopus Deploy integrates with Team Foundation Server to provide for a full automated build and deployment pipeline. This section provides information on integrating Octopus Deploy and TFS. The procedures on this page have been verified against Visual Studio 2013 but should also work with previous versions of TFS.

**Using VSTS/VSO or TFS 2015 Update 2?**
We have built a [comprehensive extension for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](/docs/api-and-integration/visual-studio-team-services-vsts.md) (formerly Visual Studio Online or VSO) which also works with TFS 2015 Update 2. We highly recommend using this extension for VSTS/VSO and TFS 2015 Update 2 or newer.

## Packaging applications when building with Team Build {#TeamFoundationServer(TFS)-PackagingapplicationswhenbuildingwithTeamBuild}

When Team Build builds your solution, you will need to package your applications ready to be deployed. This can be done by [installing OctoPack](/docs/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octopack/index.md) on the projects that you plan to deploy.

When defining your build definition, you can expand the **Advanced** properties to specify custom arguments for MSBuild. At a minimum, you'll need to pass:

```
/p:RunOctoPack=true
```

**OctoPack**
There are plenty of other properties that you can pass here. For example, you can tell OctoPack to publish the resulting packages to a file share or another NuGet repository. See the "Publishing a new package to Octopus" section below, or [Learn more in the section on OctoPack](/docs/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octopack/index.md).

Publishing a new package to Octopus

In most cases, you'll want to push your newly-created package to the built-in Octopus Deploy NuGet repository. To do this, you can use two additional MSBuild arguments to tell OctoPack to publish the package(s).

```
/p:OctoPackPublishPackageToHttp=http://my-octopus-server/nuget/packages
```

```
/p:OctoPackPublishApiKey=API-ABCDEFGMYAPIKEY
```

**Built-in Nuget and API keys**
To find your Octopus NuGet repository URL, see the [Package repositories](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/index.md) section.

To create an API key, see the [How to create an API key](/docs/how-to/how-to-create-an-api-key.md) section.

## Deploying automatically after a build {#TeamFoundationServer(TFS)-Deployingautomaticallyafterabuild}

Version 2.6 of Octopus Deploy introduced [Lifecycles ](/docs/key-concepts/lifecycles.md)and [Automatic Release Creation](/docs/deploying-applications/automatic-release-creation.md). You can use these two features to automatically deploy to one or more environments when a new package is pushed to the built-in NuGet repository.

First, turn on Automatic Release Creation to create a new release when your package is pushed. Then, usingÂ the project Lifecycle configure one or more environments in your first phase to deploy automatically when a new release is available.

By adding these features to the steps above, you can set up complete end-to-end continuous integration:

1. OctoPack will create new NuGet packages for your projects
2. OctoPack will push those packages to the built-in NuGet repository
3. Automatic Release Creation will create a new Release
4. Your Lifecycle will trigger a deployment when the release is created

## Walkthrough {#TeamFoundationServer(TFS)-Walkthrough}

This 6 minute video walks through the above steps to create an end-to-end continuous deployment process for Team Foundation Server.
