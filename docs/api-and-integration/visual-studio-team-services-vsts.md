If you are using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) (formerly VSO) or an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2017 (or newer) you can use the [open-source](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctoTFS) extension for Octopus [available in the VSTS marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octopusdeploy.octopus-deploy-build-release-tasks). For TFS 2015 Update 2 or 3, see the [Team Foundation Server extension documentation](/docs/api-and-integration/team-foundation-server-tfs.md) for a compatible download.
