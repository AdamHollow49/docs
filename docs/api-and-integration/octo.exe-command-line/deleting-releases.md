[Octo.exe](http://docs.octopusdeploy.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=360596) can be used to delete releases from your Octopus instance. Releases deleted this way .

**Using Channels?**
If you are using channels (introduced in Octopus 3.2) you can filter this command so it only deletes releases for a particular channel.

                             ignored. WARNING: this option may create a 
                             security vulnerability.

### Basic example


The following command will delete all the releases from the project **Web** between versions **0.0.8** to **0.0.12**.

```text
octo delete-releases --project Web --minversion="0.0.8" --maxversion="0.0.12" --server http://MyOctopusServerURL.com --apikey MyAPIKey
```

:::warning
On the example above, both **minversion** and **maxversion** will be delete as well. The complete list of releases deleted by that command will be:


0.0.8, 0.0.9, 0.0.10, 0.0.11, 0.0.12.
