As your usage of Octopus grows, and you start to have many environments and many projects, *project groups* can be a useful way to organize your Octopus Deploy installation.

A project group contains a list of projects. It also groups the projects together on the dashboard.

## Creating project groups {#ProjectGroups-Creatingprojectgroups}

Project groups can be added from the projects tab, using the **Add project group** link.

## Assigning projects to project groups {#ProjectGroups-Assigningprojectstoprojectgroups}

To assign a project to a project group you can specify the project group when creating a new project:

or, to move projects between project groups, you can go to the **Settings** tab in the project, and change the project group:
