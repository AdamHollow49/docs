Octopus Server and Octopus Tentacle Docker containers are published and are now being made available for each release. Running Octopus from inside a container allows you to avoid installing Octopus directly on top of your infrastructure and makes getting up and running with Octopus as simple as a one line command.

These documents wont be diving into all the details about using Docker and running containers and assumes some minimum level of knowledge on these topics. Be sure to read the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/) for more in-depth and up to date information.

- [Octopus Tentacle Container](octopus-tentacle-container.md)
- [Octopus Docker Compose Project](docker-compose.md)

:::info

Both of the containers are built on top of the `microsoft/windowsservercore:latest` base image so at the time of writing they will only run on Windows where the [Windows Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/) feature has been enabled. The images are available from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/octopusdeploy/) and the DockerFiles can be accessed via the open source [Octopus-Docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Octopus-Docker).
