:::warning
The Octopus Deploy Server Windows containers are deprecated, and no longer maintained. 

Microsoft also [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server/update-beta-program-for-sql-server-on-windows-container-is/ba-p/2516639) that from July 5th 2021 they were suspending support for the SQL Server on Windows Containers beta program for the foreseeable future, due to the existing ecosystem challenges and usage patterns.

For hosting Octopus Server in a container, we recommend using the [Octopus Server Linux Container](/docs/installation/octopus-in-container/docker-compose-linux.md).

Please refer to this [guide](/docs/installation/octopus-in-container/migrate-to-server-container-linux-from-windows-container.md) on how to migrate your existing Octopus Server Windows Container over to Octopus Server Linux Container.
