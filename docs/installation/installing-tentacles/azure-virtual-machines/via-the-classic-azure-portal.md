:::problem
**Azure VM Extension not currently available via he Azure Portal**
The Octopus Tentacle VM extension is temporarily unavailable from the Azure Classic Portal. We are working with Microsoft to rectify this and you can watch [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/2859) to be notified of progress. In the meantime, you can install the extension [via the Azure CLI](via-the-azure-cli.md) or [via PowerShell](via-powershell.md).
