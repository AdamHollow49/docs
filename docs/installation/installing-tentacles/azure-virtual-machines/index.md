If you deploy software to virtual machines (VM's) hosted in Microsoft Azure, Octopus Deploy makes it easy to install the [Tentacle agent](/docs/installation/installing-tentacles/index.md).Â This page explains how to install the Tentacle agent extension for Azure VM's, and how to diagnose problems when using the extension.

## Overview {#AzureVirtualMachines-Overview}

The Azure Tentacle VM extension is an extension that can be added to an Azure virtual machine. Currently, only Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 are supported.

When enabled, the extension automatically downloads the latest Tentacle MSI, installs it, and registers the agent with your [Octopus Server](/docs/installation/installing-octopus/index.md). After Azure deploys the extension to your VM, it executes a series of commands very similar to the those listed in our guide to [automatically installing the Tentacle agent](/docs/installation/installing-tentacles/automating-tentacle-installation.md).

The VM extension can be installed in a variety of ways. Please refer to the appropriate page for details.
