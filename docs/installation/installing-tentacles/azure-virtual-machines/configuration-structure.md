title: Tentacle VM Extension Configuration Structure
description: Detailed file format information for the configuration files required for the Azure Tentacle VM Extension
position: 6
---

:::hint
The Azure VM Extension is currently in preview.
:::

These files are required to install the extension [via the Azure CLI](via-the-azure-cli.md) or [via PowerShell](via-powershell.md).

## Public Settings

The schema for the public configuration file is:

```json
{
  "OctopusServerUrl": "https://octopus.example.com",
  "Environments": [
    "Test",
    "Production"
  ],
  "Roles": [
    "web-server",
    "app-server"
  ],
  "CommunicationMode": "Listen",
  "Port": 10933
}

```

* `OctopusServerUrl`: (string) The url to the Octopus server portal.
* `Environments`: (array of string) The environments to which the Tentacle should be added.
* `Roles`: (array of string) The roles to assign to the Tentacle.
* `CommunicationMode`: (string) Whether the Tentacle should wait for connections from the server (`Listen`) or should poll the server (`Poll`).
* `Port`: The port on which to listen for connections from the server (in `Listen` mode), or the port on which to connect to the Octopus server (`Poll` mode).

:::hint
In `Listen`ing mode, the Tentacle will register using the hostname of the machine. Therefore, you will need to ensure that there is hostname resolution from your Octopus Server to the Tentacle. The extension will automatically add a Windows Firewall rule to allow traffic, but you will still need to ensure that endpoints / NSG rules are added to allow network traffic to reach the server.

## Private Settings

The schema for the private configuration file is:

```json
{
  "ApiKey": "API-1234567890ABCDEF1234567890"
}
```

* `ApiKey`: (string) The Api Key to use to connect to the Octopus server.

The private configuration will be encrypted by Azure, and is only decryptable on the Azure VM using a special certificate installed by the Azure VM Agent.
