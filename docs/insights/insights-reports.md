Insights Reports provide actionable DORA metrics for more complex scenarios across projects, project groups, environments, or tenants.

## Settings

You must select at least one project and one environment group before a report can be generated.

Selecting a Project Group will include all projects in that group in the report. You can select a combination of project groups and single projects.

Environment groups are unique to Insights Reports. They are a way to logically group environments. For example, if you have multiple production environments, you would create a Production group and include those environments.

Tenants are optional. You have the ability to select single tenants or Tenant Tags. Selecting a tag will include all of the tenants with that tag in your report.

You can give your report a name, description and logo. You can either upload an image or use the icon picker.

## Projects

- You can select both project groups and single projects
- Any intersecting projects will only be included once

## Environments
- Environment groups must have a unique name
- An environment can only exist in one group

## Tenants
The tenant selection works like it does in other sections of Octopus:

- There is a multi-select for Tenants
- There is a multi-select for each Tenant Tag Set

Any tenants with the selected tags will be included in the report

## Charts

The tiem range select for reports works the same as it does for project level insights.
