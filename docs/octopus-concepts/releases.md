## Creating a Release

A [Release](/docs/deployment-process/releases/index.md) is a snapshot of your deployment process, configuration variables, and software packages. Releases are created from Projects and deployed via a Lifecycle to your Environments.

## Deploying a Release

When you [deploy a release](/docs/deployment-process/releases/index.md), you are executing the deployment process with all the associated details, as they existed when the release was created. You can deploy a release as many times as you want to.
