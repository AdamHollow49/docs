Octopus Deploy is built **API-first**. This means that Octopus is built in layers - all data and operations are available over its REST API.Â The Octopus Web Portal (the main Octopus UI) is actually built on top of this API. In the Octopus Web Portal, we don't use any shortcuts - 100% of the data and operations that you can see and perform in the Octopus UI can be performed over the REST API.
