title: Package

A [Package](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md) is an archive (zip, tar, NuGet) that contains all the files needed to run your software. You can host Packages in external repositories or the built-in Octopus repository. The package will need to be named correctly with a [package ID](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md#package-id), [version number](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md#version-numbers) and as a [supported format](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md#supported-formats), for Octopus to recognize it. For example MyPackage.1.0.1.zip
