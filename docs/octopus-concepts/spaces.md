## Spaces

With [Spaces](/docs/administration/spaces/index.md) you can give each team their own set of projects, environments, and infrastructure that is separate from the other teams.
Users can be members of multiple teams and have access to multiple spaces, but the entities and infrastructure they work with will only be available in the space it is assigned to.
If you're a large organization with lots of teams working in Octopus, from **2019.1** you can use the [Spaces](/docs/administration/spaces/index.md) feature.
