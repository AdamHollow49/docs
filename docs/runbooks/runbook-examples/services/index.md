Octopus can deploy the services that your application depend on.  Working with services often requires direct access to the server and elevated permissions.  With Runbooks, you can give users a self-service method to perform operations on services without giving them access to the server or any special permissions.

Typical services operations:
- Start service
- Stop service
- Restart service
