Octopus is great for automating your database deployments, but databases also need routine maintenance, and Runbooks can be used to automate this without creating new deployment releases. 

Typical database maintenance could be:

- [Database Backups](/docs/runbooks/runbook-examples/backup-mssql-database.md)
- Creating Databases 
- Index rebuilding 
- Checking Database integrity
- [Restoring Databases](/docs/runbooks/runbook-examples/restore-mssql-database.md)
- [Restoring Databases to another environment](/docs/runbooks/runbook-examples/restore-mssql-database.md)
