The below links provide detailed information on setting up a build process that packages your application in an Octopus-compatible way, using the most popular build technologies out there.

:::hint
**Your Application type is not here?**
If the *Application-Build Server* combination you are using is not in the below list, the idea is that you check our [Packaging Applications section](/docs/packaging-applications/creating-packages/applications/index.md), look for your Application Type and then implement that same process in one of the below build server technologies.
