The below links will lead you to detailed guides on how to package specific types of applications **Locally** in your workstation. The idea is that once you fully understand how this process works, you can later on translate it to your [Build Process](/docs/packaging-applications/creating-packages/build-tools/index.md).

|  Application Type | Language/Framework  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|
| [ASP.NET MVC App]()  | C# - .NET Core 2  |   |
| [ASP.NET Core Web App]()  | C# - .NET Core 2  | Including *Webjobs* to run on Azure  |
| [ASP.NET MVC App]()  | C# - .NET 4.5  |   |
| [Console Application]()  | C# - .NET 4.5  |   |
| [Library]()  | C# - .NET 4.5  |   |
| [React.JS Web app]()  | Javascript - WebPack  |   |
| [Java stuff]()  | Java |   |
