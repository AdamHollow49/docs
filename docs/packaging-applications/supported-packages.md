Octopus Deploy supports several package types that can be used when [packaging your applications](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md) and will continue to add more in the future.

Octopus uses the **file extension** to determine the correct extraction algorithm to use, so it is important that your package has the correct extension for the package format.

| Package Type | File Extensions           | Notes                                    |

| NuGet        | *.nupkg*                   |Any NuGet repository (including the [Built-In repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository.md)) | Currently only NuGet packages will have extra metadata like release notes and description extracted from the package metadata. |
| Tar          | *.tar*                   | [Built-In repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository.md) only | An archive file primarily used in non Windows environments. |
| Tar + Gzip   | *.tgz, .tar.gz, .tar.Z | [Built-In repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository.md) only |                                          |
| Tar + Bzip2  | *.tar.bz, .tar.bz2, .tbz* | [Built-In repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository.md) only |                                          |
| Zip          | *.zip*                     | [Built-In repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository.md) only | Standard zip file as created through most common zip programs. |
| Docker Image |                            | [Docker Registries](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/registries/index.md) | Learn about [Docker](/docs/deploying-applications/docker-containers/index.md) and Octopus Deploy. |
| JAR WAR EAR RAR | .jar, .war, .ear, .rar  |  [Built-In repository](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository.md) (and [Maven Feeds](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/maven-feeds.md) from 4.1) |  Learn about [Maven Feeds](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/maven-feeds.md). |

:::warning
**Pre-Release packages and Multipart file extensions**

If you are using a file format with a multi-part file extension (e.g. `.tar.gz`) along with a pre-release naming convention (`MyApp.1.0.0-beta.tar.gz`) the `.tar` forms part of pre-release tag and not part of the file extension. This results in an error message of `Unsupported file extension .gz`. 

This applies only to `Run on Server` steps only as deployments executed on a Tentacle go through a different code path.
