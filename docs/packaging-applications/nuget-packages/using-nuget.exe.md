title: Using NuGet.exe

---


While [using OctoPack](/docs/home/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octopack.md) is the preferred way to create NuGet packages for Octopus, OctoPack has some limitations: namely, it has to be installed into a C# or Visual Basic project.


For other scenarios, you can use the NuGet.exe command line tool to create packages.

:::hint
You can download Nuget and read full documentation on NuGet.exe usage at the [NuGet.exe pack command line reference](http://docs.nuget.org/consume/command-line-reference#package-authoring-commands).
