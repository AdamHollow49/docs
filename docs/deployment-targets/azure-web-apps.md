:::warning
Azure Web App deployment targets have been deprecated in Octopus 3.1, and have been replaced by the 'Deploy an Azure Web App Step'.
Don't worry - you can migrate your Azure Targets to use the equivalent Azure Steps by following [this guide](/docs/how-to/migrate-azure-targets-into-azure-steps.md).
