Accounts allow you to capture machine and subscription details used within your deployments. Add your Azure subscription to accounts and use one of the Azure built-in step templates to deploy to the cloud. Although Azure subscriptions are associated with deployment targets, they are not visible on the environments page with the other targets.

If you are deploying to a Linux target, SSH, username and passwords can be stored under accounts. 

To add an account, go to the environments page and click on the Accounts link.
