## Octopus in Your Delivery Process {#Gettingstarted-Octopusinyourdeliveryprocess}

Octopus Deploy is an automated deployment server that makes it easy to automate the deployment of ASP.NET web applications, Java applications, and Windows Services into development, test, and production environments.

The Octopus Deploy server works together with lightweight agent services, called Tentacles, that are installed on the machines you plan to deploy your web apps, applications, or services to. With Octopus and Tentacle, you can easily deploy to your own servers or cloud services from providers like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.

### The Delivery Pipeline

We designed Octopus to fit into teams that follow agile delivery practices. A typical workflow would be:

1. Commit Code to Your Existing Source Control System.

   You might be using Git, Team Foundation Server, Subversion, or Mercurial; the choice is yours.

1. Your CI/Build Server Compiles the Code and Runs Unit Tests.

   You might be using TeamCity, Jenkins, Bamboo, Team Foundation Server, or CruiseControl.NET, again, the choice is yours.

1. Package Your Application.

   When the build is ready, your CI/build server bundles all of the files (binaries, images, scripts, configuration files, and so on) needed to deploy your application into a [supported package](/docs/packaging-applications/supported-packages.md).

1. Octopus Deploy Pushes Your Packaged Application.

   Octopus deploys the applications to the environments you've configured. These could be testing, dev, or production environments. 

### Consistent Releases

As a release manager, you define the process for deploying the software. You can specify the environments the applications are deployed to and who on your team can deploy to which environments; for instance, you might want testers to deploy to test environments, but not to production. Taking this approach means that even if different members of the team are triggering deployments, the deployment process remains consistent.

The rest of this guide goes into more detail about working with  Octopus Deploy and links to the relevant sections of the documentation for more information.

## Install Octopus Deploy

Installing [Octopus Deploy](/docs/installation/index.md) sets up the central [Octopus Deploy Server](/docs/installation/installing-octopus/index.md) which runs as a Windows Service on one of your servers. Octopus stores its data in an [SQL Server Database](/docs/installation/installing-octopus/sql-server-datasbase-requirements.md) and includes an embedded HTTP server which serves the [Octopus REST API](/docs/api-and-integration/octopus-rest-api.md) and the **Octopus Web Portal**.

The [Installation documentation](/docs/installation/index.md) provides the instructions for installing and configuring your Octopus.

## Access the Octopus Web Portal

**To Do! - provide a very high level overview**

## Configure Your Infrastructure

### Environments

Octopus groups your infrastructure into environments. Environments are groups of machines that you deploy to at the same time; for instance, you might have an environment of test servers that you deploy your apps to as part of your QA process, a UAT environment, and a production environment. Grouping machines in this way let's you define your deployment processes (no matter how many machines are involved) and have Octopus deploy the right versions of your apps to the right environments at the right time.

:::info
Throughout this guide we refer to both your servers and the cloud services you deploy your applications to as **machines**. 
:::

Learn how to add and manage environments in the [Environments documentation]().

### Machine Roles

Every machine in your environments is tagged with a set of roles. 

![](sample-environments.png)
In production, your web sites and Windows Services might run on different physical servers; perhaps dozens of them. However, unless you are extremely lucky, it's unlikely that you have the budget to have an equal number of servers in any of your pre-production environments. When testing your software in a test environment, you might only have a single virtual machine which will run all of the web sites and services on the same machine.

Octopus handles these differences by introducing a layer of indirection: roles. Instead of saying:

> The trading website ASP.NET application should be deployed to PWEB01, PWEB02, ...

We say:

> The trading website ASP.NET application should be deployed to machines that are tagged with the **web-server** role.

In production, perhaps you have 10 machines with the web-server role. In staging, perhaps you have only 4. In test, perhaps there is a single machine. Roles make defining your deployment process much easier.

You can define as many environments, machines, and roles as you need; it all depends on how your applications are deployed.

Learn more about machine roles **TODO!!!**

### Install Tentacles

The central Octopus Deploy Server works with Tentacles. Tentacle is a secure, lightweight agent service that Octopus uses to deploy software to your infrastructure. That infrastructure could be your own servers or cloud services from providers like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.

The [Installation documentation](/docs/installation/index.md) provides the instructions for installing and configuring your Tentacles.

### Deployment Targets


Deployment targets represent the servers, machines and cloud services where your application and services will be deployed. 

On each of the servers, you'll need to install the lightweight Tentacle agent, and then register the targets in your environments. Depending on network/firewall configuration, Tentacles can be installed in [listening](/docs/installation/installing-tentacles/listening-tentacles.md) (Octopus calls Tentacle) or [polling](/docs/installation/installing-tentacles/polling-tentacles.md) (Tentacle polls Octopus) mode. If you have many machines to manage, you can [install Tentacles automatically](/docs/installation/installing-tentacles/automating-tentacle-installation.md). One Octopus server can control many Tentacles, potentially a lot more than 8! 

![Add machines to environment](deployment-targets.png "width=500")

Learn more about the [deployment targets](/docs/deployment-targets/index.md).


### Accounts

### Add an account {#Gettingstarted-Addanaccount}

Accounts allow you to capture machine and subscription details used within your deployments. Add your Azure subscription to accounts and use one of the Azure built-in step templates to deploy to the cloud. Although Azure subscriptions are associated with deployment targets, they are not visible on the environments page with the other targets.

If you are deploying to a Linux target, SSH, username and passwords can be stored under accounts. 

To add an account, go to the environments page and click on the Accounts link. 

![](infrastructure-accounts.png "width=500")

![](accounts.png "width=500")

Learn more about [accounts](/docs/key-concepts/environments/accounts/index.md).

## Packaging Applications
### Package and version applications for deployment {#Gettingstarted-Packageyourapplicationsfordeployment}

Whenever you want to deploy applications with Octopus, you'll need to package them into NuGet, zip, tar, tar gzip or tar bzip2 packages. A package contains an applicationâ€™s executables, configuration files, scripts and any other files it needs to run. Once packaged, it will need to be versioned.

How you create the package depends on what app or service you are deploying:

- Use [OctoPack](/docs/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octopack/index.md) to package ASP.NET apps or Windows Services applications.
- Use [dotnet pack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/dotnet-pack) to package .NET Core apps.
- To package a [java](/docs/guides/deploying-java-applications.md), nodejs or other applications and folders use [Octo.exe](/docs/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octo.exe.md) or simply [zip](/docs/packaging-applications/supported-packages.md) up a folder.

Learn more about [versioning](/docs/packaging-applications/versioning-in-octopus-deploy.md) and [packaging](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md).

### Upload package {#Gettingstarted-Uploadpackage}

Your packages need to be placed into a package repository. You can either push packages to the built-in repository manually or integrate with your existing build tool.  We recommend configuring your existing tool chain to push packages automatically to the built-in repository. 

![Octopus built-in package repository](library-packages.png)

Use our [TeamCity](/docs/api-and-integration/teamcity.md), [VSTS](/ /docs/api-and-integration/tfs-vsts/using-octopus-extension/index.md) or [TFS](/docs/api-and-integration/tfs-vsts/index.md) extensions to integrate with the built-in repository or explore the [other options](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/pushing-packages-to-the-built-in-repository.md) to push packages to it.

Learn more about our [api and integration](/docs/api-and-integration/index.md).

### Add an external feed {#Gettingstarted-Addanexternalfeed}

Octopus can consume packages from external NuGet package repositories and Docker Container Registries.

An external package repository would typically be:
- A [remote feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/nuget-server) exposed over HTTP
- A [local feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds) exposed as a File Share or local directory
- A [Docker Registry](/docs/deploying-applications/docker-containers/registries/index.md)
- A [TeamCity](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2011/08/24/native-nuget-support-in-teamcity/) server (version 7 and above)
- A [MyGet](http://www.myget.org/) server
- A [VSTS or TFS Package Management](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/package/overview) feed

![Octopus external feeds area](library-externalfeeds.png)

## Projects

## 4. Create a project {#Gettingstarted-Createaproject}

### Create a project

Projects define a set of deployment steps that you want Octopus to perform, and their configuration variables.

![Creating a project](create-project.png "width=500")

Learn more about [projects](/docs/key-concepts/projects/index.md).

## Define Your Deployment Process

### Define your deployment process {#Gettingstarted-Defineyourdeploymentprocess}

The **Process** tab within your project defines how your project will be deployed. You can add different steps to the process depending on what you plan to deploy:

- To deploy changes to a SQL Server database, seeÂ [SQL Server databases](/docs/deploying-applications/sql-server-databases.md)
- To deploy an ASP.NET web site to an IIS server, seeÂ [IIS Websites and Application Pools](/docs/deploying-applications/iis-websites-and-application-pools.md)
- To install or configure a Windows Service, seeÂ [Windows Services](/docs/deploying-applications/windows-services.md)
- For custom or advanced installation actions, seeÂ [Custom scripts](/docs/deploying-applications/custom-scripts/index.md)
- To pause deployment for a human to approve or perform an action, seeÂ [Manual intervention and approvals](/docs/deploying-applications/manual-intervention-and-approvals.md)

![Your deployment process](deployment-process.png "width=500")

Chances are, you'll need to configure your application differently depending on the what you are deploying to (for example, different connection strings in staging vs. production). Octopus has advanced support for managing theseÂ [variables](/docs/deploying-applications/variables/index.md) and scoping them, and can even manage passwords securely. Octopus can also take care of automatically [updating your .NET configuration files, and running configuration file transforms](/docs/deploying-applications/configuration-files/index.md).

## Releases


## 5. You're ready to deploy

### Create release {#Gettingstarted-Createareleaseanddeployit}

Next, create a release.Â Click the **Create release** button on any page of your project.

![Creating a release](create-release-button.png "width=500")

Enter an overall release version number for the release, and select the NuGet package versions that you want to include in the release. You can also add release notes to tell your team what the release contains.

![Release notes](create-release.png "width=500")

Now that you have a release, you can deploy and promote it between environments.Â On the release page, use the green **Deploy to *environment*** button to promote it.

### Deploy a release

![Deploy the release](deploy-release.png "width=500")

The deployment page shows you a log of all the activity that happens during the deployment, on both the Octopus server and any Tentacles, including the output of any custom scripts.

![Running deployment](deployment-details.png "width=500")



Words like "release" and "deployment" are no doubt terms that you've used in your organization prior to using Octopus Deploy. Perhaps you use them interchangeably, or perhaps they have well defined meanings. As you begin to use and master Octopus, there's some potential for confusion - the concept of a Release as implemented in Octopus might be very different to the concept of a Release currently in use in your organization. This page provides a high-level overview of the various concepts that exist in Octopus, to help to eliminate that confusion.

## Releases and deployments {#KeyConcepts-Releasesanddeployments}

The deployment process for a project specifies how the project will be deployed. But Octopus isn't designed to deploy something just once; it's designed to deploy the same project over, and over, and over, and over. It's designed for teams that follow agile software development methods, continuously deploying software to environments, getting feedback, making changes, and then deploying again.

We expect that beyond the initial setup and tweaking, your deployment process won't change between all of these deployments. But of course, the software that you are deploying will. You will make changes to code, commit them to source control, and have a [build server](/docs/api-and-integration/index.md) build them and run tests. Then the software will be [packaged](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md) and ready for deployment.

In Octopus, a release is a snapshot of the *deployment process* and *variables,*Â with a set of *packages* selected. That *release* is then *deployed* to multiple environments, typically to one, then promoted to the next environment if successful.

![](/docs/images/3048100/3277799.png "width=500")

Each time you have a new candidate build that is ready to test, you'll create a *release*. When you apply a release to an environment, that is a *deployment*.


## Channels

When you start working with Octopus you will typically be creating releases from your main source code branch that are considered to be release candidates for your final production environment. Over time you may find you want to start working on an experimental branch of code, perhaps to introduce a new feature, or an entirely new version of your software. In this case you can either create an entirely new project, or clone the existing project, to manage deployments of this experimental software - but that leads to a lot of possible duplication and rework. In Octopus 3.2 we introduced the concept ofÂ [*channels* ](/docs/key-concepts/projects/channels.md)which let you modify the entire deployment process on a per-release basis, all within the same project. For example, you can promote releases created from your main code branch through to your production environment, but restrict releases created from your experimental feature branch to a special test environment perhaps with extra steps and variables.

## Tenants

Over time your software may become so successful that you on-sell it to some external customers, and due to the way the software is architected, you need to deploy a copy of the software once per customer. You could achieve this in Octopus by creating an environment-per-customer, or even a project-per-customer, but this leads to duplication and unnecessary complexity. In Octopus 3.4 we introduced the concept ofÂ [*tenants* ](/docs/key-concepts/tenants/index.md)that you can manage alongside your existing projects and environments.
