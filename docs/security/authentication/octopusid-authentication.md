:::hint
Octopus ID authentication is only available in [Octopus Cloud](/docs/octopus-cloud/index.md) and is being progressively rolled out to customers.
:::

Octopus ID authentication allows you to log in to your Octopus Cloud instance using the same account that you use to sign in at [octopus.com](https://octopus.com). This allows you to manage who is able to access your Octopus instance from [your organization](https://octopus.com/organization/) and saves you time when moving between our website and your instance.

## Inviting users and configuring teams with Octopus ID

After you've used octopus.com to [invite some other users](/docs/octopus-cloud/index.md#OctopusCloud-Invitingusers) to your instance, you can configure the users with [Teams](/docs/security/users-and-teams/index.md) and [User Roles](/docs/security/users-and-teams/user-roles.md) as you normally would using the product.
