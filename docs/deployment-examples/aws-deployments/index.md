Octopus Deploy provides first-class support for deploying AWS CloudFormation templates and uploading files to s3 buckets.

The `Deploy an AWS CloudFormation Template` step can be used to create or update a CloudFormation stack, while the `Delete an AWS CloudFormation stack` step can be used to delete an existing CloudFormation stack.
