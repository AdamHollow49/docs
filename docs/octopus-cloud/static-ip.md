description: How to activate a static IP address with Octopus Cloud.
---

You can assign a static IP address to your Octopus cloud instance. This lets you:

- Connect to Listening Tentacles within your infrastructure from the Cloud.
- Whitelist the static IP address of the Octopus server in your network configuration.
- Allow connections to Linux or Unix SSH targets from the static IP address only.

## Activate your Static IP address

1. [Log in to your Octopus Account](https://account.octopus.com/instances).
2. Select **Change Billing** and pick a plan with the option to purchase a static IP address.
