We make backups of instance databases and store these securely, so we have multiple restore points in the unlikely event of a disaster.

We evaluate our backup and recovery strategy frequently, to improve resiliency and recovery as we need to.

## Importing Data

To import any projects you will need to set them up from scratch, or import them using the [Migration API](/docs/api-and-integration/migration-api.md).

## Exporting Your Data

If you need to export your data, this can be done with the [Migration API](/docs/api-and-integration/migration-api.md), alternatively, we can provide you with a full database backup if required. Please visit the [support page](https://octopus.com/support) if you need this.
