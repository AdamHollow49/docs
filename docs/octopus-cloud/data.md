We make regular backups of instance databases throughout the day and store these securely in blob storage, so we have multiple restore points in the unlikely case of disaster.

We evaluate our backup and recovery strategy frequently, to improve resiliency and recovery as we need to.

## Importing Data

To import any projects you will need to set them up from scratch, or import them using [octo.exe](https://octopus.com/docs/api-and-integration/octo.exe-command-line/import).
