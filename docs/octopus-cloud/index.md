**Octopus Cloud** is the hosted version of Octopus Deploy and it has been publicly available since February 2018. We designed Octopus Cloud and self-hosted Octopus to provide the same functionality; however, there are some minor differences, for instance, with Octopus Cloud, we're [responsible](/docs/administration/security/index.md#responsibility) for taking backups, automatically upgrading the service, and maintaining and monitoring the underlying systems, and for security reasons some of the configuration and diagnostic functionality has been limited. <!-- do we have specifics? -->

You can sign up for Octopus Cloud at [account.octopus.com/register](https://account.octopus.com/register), check out the [Octopus Cloud FAQ](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-cloud-faq) blog post or the [pricing page](https://octopus.com/pricing/cloud).
