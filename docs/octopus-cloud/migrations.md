:::warning
The recommended way to migrate to Octopus Cloud, is with the **Export/Import Projects** feature that was released in **Octopus 2021.1**. Learn more: [Exporting and Importing Projects](/docs/projects/export-import/index.md).

We no longer offer manual migrations from a self-hosted Octopus Server to Octopus Cloud, and vice-versa. 

Please note that our existing [Migration API](/docs/octopus-rest-api/migration-api/index.md) is **not supported** for migrations to cloud instances due to configuration differences between self-hosted and cloud installations.
