:::warning
We no longer offer manual migrations from a self-hosted Octopus Server to Octopus Cloud, and vice-versa. A new feature called **Export/Import Projects** was added in Octopus **2021.1** that will allow seamless migrations to Octopus Cloud - you can find further details in our [Exporting and Importing Projects](/docs/projects/export-import/index.md) page.

Please note that our existing [Migration API](/docs/octopus-rest-api/migration-api/index.md) is **not supported** for migrations to cloud instances due to configuration differences between self-hosted and cloud installations.
