:::hint
Always try to keep the number of environments low, under a dozen or so where possible. Doing so helps with configuring other areas of Octopus, such as Lifecycles, Channels and Security. They also keep your dashboard easy to follow. 

Take a look at our [environment recommendations](/docs/infrastructure/environments/environment-recommendations.md) section for more tips.
