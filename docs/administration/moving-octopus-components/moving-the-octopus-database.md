title: Moving the Octopus Database

---


It is possible to move your database from one Octopus server to another. Many methods exist to do this, though we recommend using the Backup option in your current database, then the Import option on the destination server.


Keep in mind that after any change like this, you will also need to update your OctopusServer.config file to match the new destination.
