To store environments, projects, variables, releases and deployment history, Octopus Deploy uses a Microsoft SQL Server database.

## Installing Octopus Server


Installing Octopus Server requires access to an existing SQL Server instance.  Refer to [SQL Server Database Requirements](/docs/home/installation/installing-octopus/sql-server-database-requirements.md) for more information on the SQL Server editions supported by Octopus Deploy and installation instructions.

## Database Backups


Octopus Deploy database backups are the responsibility of the database owner. Refer to [Backup and restore](/docs/home/administration/backup-and-restore.md) for more information about backing up Octopus Deploy.
