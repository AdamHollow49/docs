## Email Notifications {#Subscriptions-EmailNotifications}

Email notifications can be setup to send an email periodically to the users of one or moreÂ [teams](/docs/administration/managing-users-and-teams/index.md). Emails will be sent periodically according to the frequency you specify, and the email will include a digest of events that have occurred (up to a maximum of 100 events). For example, this can be useful if your team has setup automated deployments with the [Elastic and Transient Environment](/docs/guides/elastic-and-transient-environments/index.md) features of Octopus and wish to be notified if an auto-deployment is ever blocked or has failed.

Emails may also include a link to your Octopus Audit screen, filtered to match the events delivered in the email. To include this link, you need to have set the publicly-accessible URL of your Octopus instance (see the {{Configuration,Nodes,Configuration Settings}} menu or the [Server Configuration](/docs/administration/server-configuration.md) documentation for more details).
