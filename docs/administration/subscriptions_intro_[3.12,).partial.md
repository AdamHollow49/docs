Subscriptions are available in Octopus Deploy 3.5 and later

Subscriptions allow you to subscribe to events that are happening within Octopus, so you can be notified when events have occurred and react accordingly. Both **email** and **webhook** notifications are currently supported.

Subscriptions can be accessed from the `Configuration` menu.
