For team members to collaborate in the deployment of software, there needs to be trust and accountability. Octopus Deploy captures audit information whenever significant events happen in the system.

- Viewing the audit history

## What does Octopus capture?


Below is a short list of just some of the things that Octopus captures:

- Changes to [deployment processes](/docs/deploying-applications.md) and [variables](/docs/deploying-applications/variables.md)
- Create/modify/delete events for [projects](/docs/key-concepts/projects.md), [environments](/docs/key-concepts/environments.md), [deployment targets](/docs/deployment-targets.md), releases, and so on
- Environment changes, such as adding new deployment targets or modifying the environment a deployment target belongs to
- Queuing and cancelling of deployments and other tasks


## Viewing the audit history


You can view the full audit history by navigating to the **Audit** tab in the **Configuration** area.

Some audit events will also include details, which you can see by clicking the **show details** link. For example:

This feature makes it extremely easy to see who made what changes on the Octopus Deploy server.

**Special audit view permission**
In Octopus 3.4 we have introduced a new Permission called **AuditView** which allows someone to view the audit logs without needing other permissions. Learn about [managing users and teams](/docs/administration/managing-users-and-teams.md).
