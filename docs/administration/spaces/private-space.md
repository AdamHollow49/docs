:::hint
Private spaces were added in **Octopus 2022.2** as a Cloud-only feature. The feature is not currently available for on-premises instances.
:::

As the name suggests, a Private Space is just like a normal [Space](/docs/administration/spaces/index.md), except it’s just for you. No one else on your team will be able to view or edit any projects in your private space. It allows users a safe environment to learn basic Octopus concepts. It’s also a great place to experiment with workflows that aren’t ready to be shared with the rest of your company.

Each Private Space will soon be populated with a sample project to provide an example of a real-world Octopus setup.

Note:

1. Deployment targets created in your private space will be counted against your company’s license limits.
2. Once you’ve got a project working just right, it can be [exported](/docs/projects/export-import/index.md) to a shared space, where the rest of the company can collaborate as normal.
