Spaces let you partition your Octopus Server so that different teams can only access the projects, environments, and infrastructure they work with from the Spaces they are members of.

Using spaces keeps the different projects and infrastructure your teams use completely separate, which means something configured in **SpaceA**, is not available to projects in **SpaceB**. This makes it easier for large organizations with multiple teams using Octopus because each team member will only see the projects, environments, and infrastructure that is available in their space.

By default, every instance of Octopus Server since **Octopus 2018.11** comes with a default space. However, if your organization is not planning to use multiple spaces, this default Space can be safely ignored and doesn't require configuration or management. 

## Managing Spaces

Spaces are managed by navigating to {{Configuration,Spaces}}.

An Octopus Administrator, or a team member with sufficient permission, is able to create, remove or modify spaces from this screen. It is also possible to [nominate a default space](#change-the-default-space), or [disable the default space entirely](#disable-the-default-space). Each space has a logo, which is also shown in the [space switcher](#switching-between-spaces) to make it easy to identify which space is currently focused upon by the UI. There is also a search filter to quickly find the spaces that you are interested in managing, this searches over the name and description fields of each space.

### The Space Manager

Each space has a **Space Manager**. The space manager is the Administrator for that Space and is responsible for managing users and teams to the space and assigning permissions to them.

When creating a new space, you are required to nominate a team member (or a team) to the role of space manager. This space manager is then responsible for [managing teams and permissions](/docs/managing-users-and-teams) within that space.

The user who creates a space doesn't necessarily need to be the space manager of the space. This enables a 'hands off' administrative approach suited to larger organizations or those who which to which to separate the duties of Octopus Server Administration, from the duties of Team Administration.

Behind the scenes, a **Space Managers** team is created, and any users that are nominated to be a space manager, are put in that team. This team cannot be created or deleted, and serves no other purpose than applying the correct space manager permissions. 

### Create a Space {#create-a-space}

New spaces are added from the configuration section of the portal.

1. To create a new Space navigate to {{Configuration,Spaces}} and select **ADD SPACE**.
2. Give the Space a name.
3. Give the Space a manager. This can be individual users or teams. Either can be selected from the drop-down menu. Click **SAVE**.
4. Provide a description for the Space.
5. Optionally, upload a logo for the Space.
6. Click **SAVE**.

### Modify a Space

You can modify a space by navigating to {{Configuration,Spaces}} and selecting the space you want to modify. Expand the field you would like to change and click **SAVE** to save your changes.

Here you can rename a space, give it a new logo, modify the space managers, or even stop the spaces task queue from processing.

### Delete a Space

You can delete spaces when you are the **Space manager**. Deleting a space cannot be undone, and the space and all of its contents, including projects, environments, releases, and deployment history will be deleted.

1. Navigate to {{Configuration,Spaces}} and select the space you want to delete.
1. Expand the **Task Queue Status** section and select the Stop task queue checkbox, and click **SAVE**.
1. Click the overflow button and select **Delete**.
1. Enter the name of the space and click **DELETE**.

## Change the Default Space {#change-the-default-space}

The **Default space** is provided to existing installations as a mechanism to ensure that the instance operates in much the same way as it did prior to upgrading to a 'spaces enabled' build. Enabled by default, it's primary function is to provide an initial space for any existing artifacts, including our built in data at installation time, and effectively hides the existence of spaces until you are ready to start using them.

It is possible to change the default space:

> Note: that the following carries some minor downtime for any automation that relies on the default space being available
 
1. Navigate to {{Configuration,Spaces}} and [disable the default space](#disable-the-default-space)
2. Return to {{Configuration,Spaces}} and select the space that you wish to nominate as the default space
3. Click the overflow button and select **Enable the default space**.

## Disable the Default Space {#disable-the-default-space}

For organizations that are new to Octopus, especially those that make heavy use of spaces, a default space is not necessarily required and therefore we have made it possible to remove the default space entirely. However, this comes with some considerations that should be weighed carefully against the needs of your organization.

In addition to providing a home for existing resources, the default space allows any existing API calls that do not explicitly set a `Space Identifier` in the route, to be routed to the default space. For example, in the case where the default space ID is `Spaces-1` then the route `/api/projects/my-project` is equivalent to `/api/Spaces-1/projects/my-project`.

> With a default space enabled, any REST API calls that do not specify a space in the URL will be assumed to be directed to the default space. **By turning off the default space, this will no longer be the case. If you have a lot of bespoke automation relying on raw REST API calls, you will need to make changes to ensure these scripts explicitly specify the Space ID in the route. Otherwise they will break with the default space turned off.**

This means that by disabling the default space - **you are opting into a non-backwards compatible scenario**, so be prepared! Things to check include:

   - Scripts you've written that directly call the API
   - Integrations with Octopus Server are updated to their latest versions (like TFS, ADO & Team City plugins)
   - Community library templates that use the API are updated (you can [refer to this PR](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Library/pull/750) as a guide)

To disable the default space:

1. Navigate to {{Configuration,Spaces}} and select the default space.
2. Expand the **Task Queue Status** section and select the Stop task queue checkbox, and click **SAVE**.
3. Click the overflow button and select **Disable the default space**.
4. Enter the name of the space and click **YES I'M SURE**.


## Switching Between Spaces {#switching-between-spaces}

When you log into the Octopus Web Portal, the first item on the navigation menu is the Spaces menu. Click this icon to access the spaces you are a member of and to select the space you need.

## System Scoped or Space Scoped {#system-scope-space-scoped}

There is a hard barrier between Spaces, so, for instance, a deployment target configured for SpaceA isn't available to projects in SpaceB. However, there are some things that aren't scoped to a space, but are available system wide. <!-- content explaining why things are scoped the way they are goes here -->

The following table shows what is space-scoped, system-scoped, or scoped to both.

| Resource              | Space-Scoped                | System-Scoped |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |

## Automation changes to be aware of {#automation-changes}

As always, using our [client libraries]() offer the best chance of a successful upgrade for your existing automation, and our latest release of Octopus Client has all the changes required to inter-operate with any version of Octopus, as do most of our plugins for other build systems. However, due to the depth and breadth of the changes required to make spaces a reality, we weren't able to maintain backwards compatibility for the REST API in all cases.

Please refer to [the release notes](<!-- todo -->) for a complete list of breaking changes.

## When should I use Spaces?
Spaces is extremely useful for organizations that have any number of the following characteristics:
- Many groups of engineers across many projects
- Requires separation of duties
- Completely autonomous teams of engineers, each responsible for their entire process
- Large number of projects or environments have created a cluttered dashboard and you just want to tidy them up

### When shouldn't I use Spaces?

While spaces is an exciting feature, it isn't going to fix every problem, or be useful in every workplace. For example, 
if you need to share resources that would normally be space scoped, to the whole system, then you might want to stick with the
default space only for now.
