Spaces let you partition? your Octopus Server so that different teams access the projects, environments, and infrastructure they work with from different areas of the Web Portal (and API?). Using Spaces keeps the projects and environments completely separate, which if you have multiple projects and teams within Octopus can make it easier to manage, but also gives you an element of separation between the different spaces you configure.

Limitations: Three Spaces per server? Migration. Sharing across spaces...
