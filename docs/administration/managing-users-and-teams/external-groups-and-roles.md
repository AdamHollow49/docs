The search on this dialog will locate any groups in the domain that start with the text you provide.

### Trusted Domains


If your environment has trusted domains, you can search for groups in the trusted domain by prefixing the search text with "**domain\**" (where domain is the name of the Trusted Domain).

## Add External Role


This button appears if you have an external authentication provider enabled (e.g. Azure AD), and when activated you will see the following dialog

The Role Id corresponds to the role id from the external provider (learn more about [roles for Azure AD](/docs/home/administration/authentication-providers/azure-ad-authentication.md)), Display Name is purely for display in the Team page.
