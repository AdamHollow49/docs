We pride ourselves on making Octopus Deploy a secure product. The security and integrity of your Octopus Deploy installation is the result of a partnership between us as the software vendor, and you as the host and administrators of your installation.

This section provides information about the responsibility we take to provide a secure software product, and considerations for you as the host and administrator of your Octopus Deploy installation.

## Prevention of common vulnerabilities and exploits

To make Octopus Deploy useful to your organization it needs a high level of access to your servers and infrastructure. We take great care to understand common vulnerabilities and exploits which could affect your Octopus Deploy installation, and ensure our software prevents anyone from leveraging these.

## Disclosure policy

No software is ever bug free, and as such, there will occasionally be security issues. Once we have fixed a verified security vulnerability we follow a practice of [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure). You can view the entire list of disclosed security vulnerabilities in the [MITRE CVE database](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16785/product_id-39115/Octopus-Octopus-Deploy.html).
