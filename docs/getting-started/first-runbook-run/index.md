If you are new to Octopus Deploy and would like to learn by doing this tutorial is for you.  By the end of this tutorial you will have completed your first deployment of a sample application to one or more of your servers.

If you haven't already signed up for a free-self hosted license or free cloud instance you can do so on our [sign-up page](https://octopus.com/free).  If you do elect to run the self-hosted version of Octopus Deploy, please follow our [installation guide](docs/installation/index.md#install-octopus).  

This tutorial is expected to take between **25-35 minutes** to complete and will cover:

1. [Configure environments](docs/getting-started/first-deployment/configure-environments.md)
2. [Create projects](docs/getting-started/first-deployment/create-projects.md)
3. [Define a deployment process](docs/getting-started/first-deployment/define-the-deployment-process.md)
4. [Create a release and deploy it](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/create-and-deploy-a-release.md)
5. [Defining and using variables](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/define-and-use-variables.md)
6. [Approvals with manual interventions](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/approvals-with-manual-interventions.md)
7. [Adding deployment targets](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/add-deployment-targets.md)
8. [Deploying a package to the deployment targets](/docs/getting-started/first-deployment/deploy-a-package.md)

By the end of step 4, you will have run a "hello world" script.  Once you have completed all 8 steps you will have configured and deployed our sample [hello world package.](https://octopus.com/images/docs/hello-world.1.0.0.zip) to one or more of your servers.
