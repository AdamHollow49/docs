This guide will provide a set of best practices / recommendations you can adopt with your Octopus Deploy instance.  Like any best practices guide, it won't cover 100% of all scenarios; adopt and modify them to match your company's requirements.  It is also a living document, this guide will change as new features are added to Octopus Deploy.  

This guide assumes you are starting from scratch, you haven't installed Octopus Deploy on your infrastructure, or configured anything in your Octopus Cloud instance.  You can read it from start to finish, or jump between sections.
