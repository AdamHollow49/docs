You can use the REST API to manage a project's [deployment process]((/docs/deployment-process/index.md)). Typical tasks might be:

- Changing the  [package feed](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/index.md) for a step.
- Finding steps in a deployment process which use a specific [target role](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/index.md#target-roles).
- Creating a new script step in a project.
- Adding an [environment run condition](/docs/deployment-process/conditions/index.md#environments) to a set of steps.
