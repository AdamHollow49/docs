You can use the REST API to create and manage your [deployment targets](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/index.md) in Octopus. Typical tasks can include:

- Registering a [listening tentacle](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/windows-targets/tentacle-communication.md#listening-tentacles-recommended).
- Registering a [polling tentacle](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/windows-targets/tentacle-communication.md#polling-tentacles).
- Adding an [Azure Web App](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/azure/web-app-targets/index.md).
- Updating a deployment target's [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md).
- Deleting a target based on a matching [target role](/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/index.md#target-roles).
