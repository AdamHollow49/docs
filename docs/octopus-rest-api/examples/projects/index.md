You can use the REST API to create and manage your Octopus [projects](/docs/projects/index.md). Typical tasks can include:

- Creating a project.
- Finding projects which match certain criteria. For example:
  - where they have a manual intervention step.
  - where they have a specific package referenced.
- Deleting a project.
