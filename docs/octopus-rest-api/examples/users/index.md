You can use the REST API to create and manage your Octopus [Users and Teams](/docs/security/users-and-teams/index.md) and Teams. Typical tasks can include:

- Finding users that have a specific [User Role](/docs/security/users-and-teams/user-roles.md).
- Creating an [API Key](/docs/octopus-rest-api/how-to-create-an-api-key.md).
- Deleting an API Key.
