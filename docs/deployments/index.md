Deploying software with Octopus Deploy involves [packaging your applications](/docs/packaging-applications/index.md) and [configuring your infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/index.md). With those two completed, you define your [deployment process](/docs/deployment-process/index.md) by creating a [project](/docs/projects/index.md), adding [steps](/docs/deployment-process/steps/index.md),  [configuration variables](/docs/projects/variables/index.md), and creating [releases](/docs/releases/index.md).

When you deploy a release, you execute the deployment process with all the included assets as they existed when the release was created.
