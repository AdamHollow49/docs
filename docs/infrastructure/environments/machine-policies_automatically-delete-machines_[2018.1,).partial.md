Machine policies can be configured to automatically remove unavailable machines after a time period.  When a health check runs, Octopus detects if machines are unavailable (cannot be contacted). When the **Automatically delete unavailable machines** option is set, Octopus checks how long a machine has been unavailable.  If the specified time period has elapsed, the machine is permanently deleted from Octopus.
