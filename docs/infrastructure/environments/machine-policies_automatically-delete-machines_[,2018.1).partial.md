Machine policies can be configured to automatically remove unavailable machines after a time period.  When a health check runs, it will detect if a machine is unavailable (cannot be contacted). When this option is set to **Automatically delete unavailable machines,** Octopus will periodically check how long the machine has been unavailable.  If the specified time has elapsed, the machine will be permanently deleted from Octopus.
