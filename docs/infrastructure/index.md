With Octopus Deploy you can deploy software to Windows servers, Linux servers, Microsoft Azure, AWS, an offline package drop, cloud regions, or Kubernetes. These machines and services are your *deployment targets*, and because software is typically deployed to more than one machine (or deployment target) Octopus organizes your deployment targets into groups called [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md). Typical environments are **Development**, **Test**, and **Production**, you can also assign [target roles](/docs/infrastructure/target-roles/index.md) to your deployment targets to further refine which deployment targets your software is deployment to. You can use [workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md) to perform tasks that don't need to be performed on a deployment target or on the Octopus Server.

You can manage your environments, deployment targets, and workers from the **Infrastructure** tab of the **Octopus Web Portal**.

## Adding Accounts

You need to set up accounts for certain deployment targets before you can use them:

- [Azure Subscriptions](/docs/infrastructure/azure/index.md)
- [Amazon Web Services Accounts](/docs/infrastructure/aws/index.md)
- [SSH Key Pairs](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-targets/ssh-key-pair.md)
- [Username/Passwords](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-targets/username-and-password.md)
- Tokens

## Adding Deployment Targets to Environments

Deployment targets are added to environments in different ways, depending on the type of target and how they will communicate with the Octopus Deploy Server.

- [Listening and Polling Windows Tentacles](/docs/infrastructure/windows-targets/index.md)
- [SSH Connection](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-targets/index.md)
- [Offline Package Drop](/docs/infrastructure/offline-package-drop.md)
- [Azure Web App](/docs/infrastructure/azure/web-app-targets/index.md)
- [Azure Cloud Service](/docs/infrastructure/azure/cloud-service-targets/index.md)
- [Azure Service Fabric Cluster](/docs/infrastructure/azure/service-fabric-cluster-targets/index.md)
- Kubernetes (Currently in beta)
- [Cloud Regions](/docs/infrastructure/cloud-regions.md)

## Workers

Octopus comes with a [built-in worker](/docs/administration/workers/built-in-worker.md) that can run scripts and perform tasks that don't run on deployment targets. You can configure [external workers](/docs/infrastructure/workers/index.md) and pools of workers to move these tasks off the Octopus Server for better performance and increased security.
