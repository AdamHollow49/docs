With Octopus Deploy you can deploy software to Windows servers, Linux servers, Microsoft Azure, AWS, an offline package drop, or cloud regions. These machines and services are your *deployment targets*, and because software is typically deployed to more than one machine (or deployment target) Octopus organizes your deployment targets into groups called *environments*. Typical environments are **Test**, **Stage**, and **Production**.

In this section, learn how to:

* Configure and manage your [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md).
* Work with [Windows Targets](/docs/infrastructure/windows-targets/index.md).
* Work with [Linux and Unix Targets](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-targets/index.md).
* Work with [Microsoft Azure](/docs/infrastructure/azure/index.md)
* Work with [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/aws/index.md)
* Work with [Offline Package Drops](/docs/infrastructure/offline-package-drop.md).
* Work with [Cloud Regions](/docs/infrastructure/cloud-regions.md).
