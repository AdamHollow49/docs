With Octopus Deploy you can deploy software to Windows servers, Linux servers, Microsoft Azure, AWS, an offline package drop, or cloud regions. These machines and services are your *deployment targets*, and because software is typically deployed to more than one machine (or deployment target) Octopus organizes your deployment targets into groups called [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md). Typical environments are **Development**, **Test**, and **Production**.

Your environments and deployment targets are managed from the **Infrastructure** tab of the **Octopus Web Portal**.

## Adding Deployment Targets to Environments

Deployment targets are added to environments in different ways, depending on the type of target and how they will communicate with the Octopus Deploy Server.

- [Tentacles on Windows targets](/docs/infrastructure/windows-targets/index.md)
- [SSH targets](/docs/infrastructure/ssh-targets/index.md)
- [AWS targets](/docs/infrastructure/aws/index.md)
- [Azure targets](/docs/infrastructure/azure/index.md)

## Workers

Octopus comes with a [built-in worker](/docs/administration/workers/) that can run scripts and perform tasks that don't run on deployment targets. You can configure [external workers](/docs/) and pools of workers to move these tasks off the Octopus Server for better performance and increased security.
