With Octopus Deploy you can deploy software to Windows servers, Linux servers, Microsoft Azure, AWS, an offline package drop, or cloud regions. These machines and services are your *deployment targets*, and because software is typically deployed to more than one machine (or deployment target) Octopus organizes your deployment targets into groups called [environments](/docs/infrastructure/environments/index.md). Typical environments are **Development**, **Test**, and **Production**.

Your environments and deployment targets are managed from the **Infrastructure** tab of the **Octopus Web Portal**.

## Lifecycles

After you've configured your environments, you can define [lifecycles](/docs/infrastructure/lifecycles/index.md) that specifies how your software is promoted through your environments, and which projects are associated with which environments.

Learn more about [Lifecycles](/docs/infrastructure/lifecycles/index.md).

## Adding Deployment Targets to Environments

Deployment targets are added to environments in different ways, depending on the type of target and how they will communicate with the Octopus Deploy Server.
