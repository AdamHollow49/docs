Calamari is the command-line tool that is invoked to perform the deployment steps on the deployment target.

There are two versions of Calamari that can be installed on SSH deployment targets:

- If Mono is installed a version of [Calamari built against the full .NET framework](#mono-calamari) will be installed.
- If Mono is not installed a [self-contained version of Calamari](#self-contained-calamari) built against .NET Core will be installed on the target.

## Calamari on Mono {#mono-calamari}

[Calamari](/docs/api-and-integration/calamari.md) can execute on the [Mono framework](http://www.mono-project.com/), allowing Octopus to deploy via SSH to \*nix operating systems.

Version 3.10 or greater of Mono is required, however, we recommended a minimum of version `4.8.0`.

You can find instructions for installing Mono in the [Mono documentation](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/).

### Supported Distros

Mono supports many [platforms](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/).  

We currently execute automated tests against the following platforms:

- Centos 7.3 + Mono 4.4.2
- Debian 8.7 + Mono 4.8.0
- Fedora 23 + Mono 4.4.2
- FreeBSD 10.3 + Mono 4.6.2
- Mac OSX 10.12.5 + Mono 4.6.1
- openSUSE 13.2 + Mono 4.6.0
- Redhat 7.2 + Mono 4.4.2
- SUSE LES 12 SP2 + Mono 4.6.0
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS + Mono 3.12.1
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS + Mono 4.0.5
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS + Mono 4.6.1

## Limitations

### TLSv1.2 Support available in Mono >= 4.8.0
[TLSv1.2 support](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/releases/4.8.0/#tls-12-support) was only included from Mono version `4.8.0`. Due to the weak cryptographic nature of older encryption algorithms, many websites are no longer providing support for TLSv1 TLSv1.1 and as such clients must ensure that they are able to use TLSv1.2 in order to communicate.

Although previous versions of mono should work in most deployment scenarios, any deployments that involve the target accessing endpoints that require TLSv1.2 (for example downloading from [Maven](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/maven-feeds.md) or [GitHub](/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/github-feeds.md) feeds) may fail.

### Configuration Transformations only available in Mono >= 4.2.3  

The [Configuration Transforms](/docs/deployment-process/configuration-features/xml-configuration-variables-feature.md) feature will only work on Mono 4.2.3 and above.

This was due to a [bug with XML Transformations](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=19426).

Note that [Substitute Variables in Files](/docs/deployment-process/configuration-features/substitute-variables-in-files.md) can still be used without issue on earlier Mono versions.

### Package Repository SSL Certificates

If you configure your deployment such that the target pulls down the package itself directly from the NuGet repository, the correct SSL certificates need to also be available to Mono. By default, Mono pre 3.12 didn’t trust any certificates and the root certs in question would need to be either manually imported, or synced with Mozilla’s list by invoking `mozroots` or `cert-sync`. Thankfully Mono's latest builds perform this step during installation so it should “just work”. See [Mono’s security FAQ](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/faq/security/) for more details.

### ScriptCS and F# only in >= Mono 4.0

Support for ScriptCS and F# scripts are only available with Mono 4 and above.


## Self-contained Calamari {#self-contained-calamari}

Self-contained Calamari support was added in **Octopus 3.16**.

SSH Targets can be configured to use a self-contained build of [Calamari](/docs/api-and-integration/calamari.md). This means neither Mono nor .NET Core needs to be installed on the target server (there are still some [pre-requisite dependencies](#dependencies)).

Self-contained Calamari is built as a [.NET Core self-contained distributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd).

### Supported Distros

A list of the distros supported by .NET Core 2.0 can be found on the [.NET Core road-map](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md#net-core-20---supported-os-versions).    

### Dependencies

[.NET Core has some dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md) which must be installed on the target server.

## Limitations {#self-contained-calamari-limitations}

### ScriptCS and F# Scripts

ScriptCS and F# scripts can not execute when using a self-contained Calamari build.

ScriptCS has not been ported for .NET Core ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/issues/1183)).

 Similarly, the F# interpreter has also not yet been ported for .NET Core ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/2407)).
