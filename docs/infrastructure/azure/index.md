Octopus Deploy provides first-class support for deploying Azure Cloud Services and Azure Web Applications. To deploy software to Azure, you must add your Azure subscription to Octopus Deploy, and then use the built-in step templates to deploy to the cloud.

Learn how to [create an Azure account](/docs/infrastructure/azure/creating-an-azure-account/index.md).

:::warning
Azure Web App and Azure Cloud Service deployment targets were deprecated in Octopus 3.1. If you need to migrate your Azure Targets to use the equivalent Azure steps, following [this guide](/docs/deployment-process/migrate-azure-targets-into-azure-steps.md).
